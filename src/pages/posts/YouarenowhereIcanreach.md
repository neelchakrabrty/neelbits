And I choose to kill myself,on every new night here and there\
I write the same poem everyday,with great detail and care\
The pages run blank and I have laid myself bare\
I listen all night for your whispers by the stairs\
But I know,I know you are not coming\
And that somehow seems fair\
In the end,I scramble my brain\
I piece together familiar feelings of pain\
In the end,I wrote 44 different poems\
But oh well,the story they tell is all the same\
I hope you get to know,how I feel about you\
I hope you get to know,how I dream about you\
I hope you know,that it's all too real\
I don't want to take the shade of exotic words tonight\
Tonight,I write from a train\
Tonight,I float far away along the faint of whistle\
But,I can't forget you
I have been trying\
But, I can't
On days,when everything gets worse\
I still contain you in me\
Like the ruins of a sandcastle in the palm of a toddler\
You are everywhere I can see\
You are nowhere I can reach
