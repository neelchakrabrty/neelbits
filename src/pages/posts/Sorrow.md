I look out of my window\
The light of the tropical autumn sun bleeds in\
And it washes over my body,\
And it reprimands me for existing\
My eyes hooked up to the dots \
And dashes of people on the street,like a fentanyl drip\
To mitigate the pain a little bit\
I ran my fingertips over the cracks of my window\
When I heard the hour was coming fast\
And I docked myself, by the window pane\
Held my screams and tears in\
Kept myself within the shackles and chains\
I put on a smile I've practiced\
And braced myself for the hour to come\
I feel the light plunge through me\
Like a runaway train, headed down the interstate \
As it's light bleeds through the night\
I hear the screams of the corpses,carried deep into the light\
And I cannot take it anymore,and I am gonna give in\
And no one is going to know\
And I won't know,until I am far away from home\
Screaming, as I lose control\
And I'll try not to hurt you,as I roll \
I punch holes,in my skull\
I lick my knuckles full of blood \
I am tired,and in need of a hand\
I am a forsaken whore,at dawn\
I try to find my way back home\
I remember writing down the address on back of some envelope \
I swing from road, to road\
And wait for my toes to erode\
I feel the wavy details of my childhood\
Crashing on the harbor of what remains of my brain \
I try to recall my name, and foretell the day of my death\
I cushion myself in midst of the pain\
And the pills trying to hold it at bay\
Here stands a traveler going somewhere far away\
And I am a drunkard tumbling over the railway lines\
I held my head down to the tracks,\
And tried to listen to the distant sound of the runaway train\
Nothing but the screams of the pure\
And the damned who called it quits \
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit\
And then, I woke up in my mother's lap\
She said hello to me\
And as though she was speaking through a thick haze\
She said hello to me\
People stood all around me,preparing for a funeral to be\
I closed my eyes,I was happy,I was happy to hear them speak\
The light of the tropical autumn sun,still burnt in my eyes\
Dimly lit, but still burning nonetheless\
Beyond the suffering,beyond the pain\
The traveler still walks away\
I open my eyes, as the light hurriedly walks out\
Out of my empty northern room\
And there is no witness to my life\
And no one to want to watch me smile\
No one to crawl back to, no one to remind me of it's worth\
It's three days later when I get the call\
And there's nobody around to break my fall
