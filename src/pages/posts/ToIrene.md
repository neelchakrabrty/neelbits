Irene, step closer, don’t walk away from my words\
Let me look at your thin veiled crying eyes\
The spasms of your sadness, from inherited loss\
Will go by, I promise, just bear it for a while\
You’ll rise, like flowers in a graveyard\
And whisper under your breath, with the dead\
I’ll try to throw a word of caution in your way\
There’s no use in writing , for people who forget\
And there’s no use in singing, for the dying or the dead\
In your desperate crusade against your self\
You’ll know, no matter how much we try sometimes\
We can’t explain our love, in about 20 or so lines\
As for the ghosts of loneliness that howls in your skin\
And your desperate movements, screaming to be seen\
I stand by and capture the moments you’re in\
But it pains my heart, Irene\
To see you grieve the loss of meaning\
As the magnetic tears, clings onto your face\
I wish I could tell you, to dream a little dream\
I wish I could tell you to scream into a vacuum no one sees\
But it’s all a vacuous joke and a deliberate scheme\
And no one’s ever around to fix you from feeling like this\
Irene, step closer, don’t walk away from my words\
I’m shivering with concern, your absence is a code I cannot discern\
You’ve been told metaphors, around and around\
With worthless foam from the mouth\
I can tell you are torn\
Between staying and leaving\
But you can’t go back home\
I can tell that you have been thinking\
About running away and starting anew\
Your thoughts shaping up into beliefs within\
And you turn around to see, no one’s running with you\
Irene,\
I belong to no one\
And no one belongs to me\
That’s just the way it is\
I have nowhere to return to\
And nowhere to be\
I’d plant your sorrow within me\
And set you free\
From shackles that enslave your senses\
Your sorrow will grow stems through my bones\
And I will hold you, in my heart till it turns to stone\
I’d forever write to you, if I could\
But soon my words, not too far apart\
Will cough up a static whine, can’t help, but be misunderstood
