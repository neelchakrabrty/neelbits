I am a poet,who made a career out of being blue\
I am a poet,writing a poem for you\
I know you are tired of waking up to same mornings,where there is nothing new\
But,anyway,you\
Wake up all hopeful\
A drought runs through your lilac lips\
It's so empty within,like the polythene ghost living on the other end of it\
But,anyway,you\
Sing,hopeful songs out of tune\
I know you are a leftover afterthought\
I know they call your name,only by a careless slip of tongue\
I know you are the wrinkle in your dress\
I know you are the asterisk that follows every yes\
I know you're going away,to somewhere new\
Just to see if there is a place for you\
I know you are torn,end to end\
In search of peace that never seems to end\
I know,for you to survive every endless night\
It takes herculean strength\
I know you're afraid that all you will ever find\
Is the company of wrong friends\
I know you get lonely and walk like a convict in your own home\
I know you get lonely but have nobody to call your own\
I know you ache by the almost bare walls of your room\
I know the sound of your muffled cries as you hide away in your cautionary tomb\
I guess\
We sing the same solitary song in a different tongue\
We sing songs for lonely giants,for whom there's none
