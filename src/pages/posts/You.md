And you keep seeping into me\
Like rain from cracks of the ceiling\
Like the memory of a childhood fable\
That I have just learnt to forget\
I scoop out traces of your voice\
From the whirlpool in my palm\
I'm on my hands and knees, it's almost too dark to see\
I run from living room out onto the street\
Hop onto buses before they come down to a stationary speed\
I dress up in nice colours, and learn to speak in a certain dialect\
I spend seasons trying to pretend that I'm not in need of help\
I sing songs out of tune, of despair and refrain\
I sing about you, with a certain kind of weakness\
I try to escape the house that drowns in me\
But, I'm home and this is my retreat\
I let it kill me, I let it kill me.
