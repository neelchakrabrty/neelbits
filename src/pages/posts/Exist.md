I exist only when you think of me\
I am made up of your thoughts\
I wear my love for you in my skin\
I wear my love for you in my bones\
I am made of could've beens, and dreams of us being together\
I walk to you,hand in hand with my death\
I disintegrate,with my love for you, falling off of me\
In little white coffins,my voice reduced to a funeral serenade\
My body a burial ground for forgotten love\
I will meet you beyond the confines of language\
And beyond the bloodshed of expression\
I will hold you in my arms\
And shelter you from Decembers\
I will quote\
"If winter comes,can spring be far behind?"\
There is no threshold for my love for you\
And I drown myself in the depths of my need for you\
I let it consume me
