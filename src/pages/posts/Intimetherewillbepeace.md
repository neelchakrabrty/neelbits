In time,there will be peace,there will come new autumns\
There will be pigeons cooing in the hollows of that old house in decay\
The little girl next door,with her June eyes,will sing again\
She will whim her way through the literature\
As her father plays Tagore on the sitar

You will wear the little smile that you borrowed from your mother\
You will hum an old relic along with your grandfather\
You will run barefoot through the verandahs of your home\
As the spring sun will gnaw on your skin\
There will come a time when forgetting will not be a sin

And no one will remind you of battles lost at noon\
And no one will remind you of tales of putting up your conscience for sale\
In time, there will be peace\
There will come spring rain
