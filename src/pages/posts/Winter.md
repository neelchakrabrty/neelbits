Winter hangs itself in the autumn air\
Like a sheared out corpse to be harangued\
My home drinks blood of the deceased swallows out in the porch\
As I tiptoe my way,into the gallows of winter\
A familiar feeling follows\
Grief sews itself through the fabric of my bones\
I greet it with a smile,that has been flawlessly rehearsed\
I look sleek and beautiful, I look cursed\
And I look lovely as a rose\
And I will decompose\
Under many suns like lightbulb drones\
I soared higher, and higher than weather balloons\
And hurled my body into the rains poisoned with rainbows\
My heart throbbed like an old wound reopening\
And the distant choral droning of the ghouls of my past saturated my ears\
I could see the red sun, gnaw on what remained of the horizon\
It burnt vividly, and burnt brighter than the northern star\
I decorated my hands with needles and pins\
And my lips with ashes of forlorn grief\
And my eyes lit up,like a Christmas tree\
I closed my eyes and dreamt of a factory\
Where they bred men like me\
To house all of suffering\
A cathedral for human sins,\
A place from where nobody breaks free\
I hear faint whispers of promises for a better tomorrow,\
They sound empty and hollow\
I hear your footsteps, waltzing around in the attic hidden by the roof\
Please don’t send me back to my room\
I want to stay here for a while, with you\
I promise to lay low, like an insignificant human debris\
But you’ll do what you want to do\
No matter what I ask of you\
Chain me to your ankles,and drag me into my room\
And you’ll unshackle me, and tempt me\
To run away,\
But we both know, I have nowhere to go\
I wish I could go,where wild dandelions grow\
I wish I could glide my feet through the blades of grass that grows by the lakes of Vermont\
I wish I could feel the warmth of faith and fear in the lord that I’ve long forgotten\
I wish I could reach out straight into the guts of my suffering,and provide some comfort to mitigate the pain\
I wish I could return to my past, like a fugitive warlord plotting his revenge\
I wish I was tethered to the love of my mother, all I do now is scavenge what remains of it\
And I will have to wait,for Spring to arrive
