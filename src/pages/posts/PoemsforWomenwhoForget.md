Ardour, scurries through homes\
Where nights have been filled with warmth\
To lick the lace of laughter from the walls\
He scratches the fence on the porch\
And writes poems,with broken fingernails\
He's hungry,like a man out of time\
He wiggles out sighs from his twisted limbs\
As he writes where the bones are hid\
Of many pasts he has lived\
His hunger for poems\
Twists and turns him\
Chews through him\
Like a dog with a bone\
With no direction home\
Words drip out, from his lips\
And breast\
Like a sheared pound of beef\
Left to rest\
In his poems for Irene,\
He confronts his love for her,\
Like a living Chinese fingertrap\
His torment sears through his fingertips\
As they come to the surface of his poems\
Words boiling over with anger and bubbling all the way through\
Sold for a bargain,just to pay for some whores\
jittered through the fourth avenue,in late November\
with broken jaws,and bloated suffering that hangs on their lonely breasts\
Suffering that only made sense to Ardour\
Someday,he will meet her out there\
Lonely and frightened\
Like an abandoned Jew's harp\
Like all things, god gave us,but forgot to name\
Like all idylls of the kings\
And the features on his face\
Will blur with age\
He will meet her
