I have murdered god\
I have burnt love alive\
To build myself a hollow\
I have wasted away a life,that is borrowed\
My words have no meaning nor shape\
My voice scraped from my barren throat,a lament for the deaf\
Amongst the other nudes,my eyes reflects a neon fire\
I crawl away from the illuminated ghosts of my past\
How can I tell you,how can I tell you,that I am scared?\
Who will sing to me in an absent language again?\
For whom will I scour through foreign films, to express love in?\
Who will speak to me of brighter days,where no one blows holes in our coffins anymore?\
When will I listen again,to the whispers that gathers by your footsteps?\
How can i tell you,how can I tell you,that I am scared?\
And who,who,will ever be written about in these poems?\
And who will I sing about?\
And above all,for whom,must I live with death,so tremendously ahead of time?\
How can I tell you,how can I tell you,that I am scared?
When I have spent this borrowed time\
I want to remember you,wearing a small smile\
I will recite stupid poems,composed of wise words\
To stay with you\
Even if,for a little while
I will negotiate with death,to draw the line at the edge of infinity\
How do I live without you,you who teach me the ruins of a language that frees me from the shackles of my own cowardice?\
Can you not say,that I am scared?
