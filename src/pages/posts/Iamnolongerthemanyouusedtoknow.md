I am no longer the man you used to know\
I listen to Jazz these days,melodies at odds with my own\
I cosplay as ugly ghosts in folk tales used to scare kids\
I have returned to renewed waiting\
I have developed a habit to kill bits and bobs of the remnants\
Of our memories every night,as I ballet to Nat Cole\
All my myself\
I spin with phantoms,till I groan from my toes\
I waste away beautiful songs\
On boring whores painted in monochrome\
I detail the rooms that I live in,carefully\
With photographs of rusting bones\
Empty nights that stretches and stagnates\
Frequent me by,every now and then
Time relentlessly steals moments,\
That could be ours,as I grow old\
I sit by the window,to witness the dots and dashes of people\
On the road\
A blackbird comes to sit by me,and begins to sing\
Within a note or two, I understand it is a prayer for a meal\
On nights like these,I return to writing\
I write without structure or meaning\
I write to liberate myself from the guilt\
I write to liberate myself from the identity I have developed\
I write to unbecome yours\
To unbecome you
