In fistful debris of memories\
In wistful charm of winters in December\
In words that spell themselves out wrong\
In rust that has grown on songs\
In bus rides through the snapshot of a city\
In sites of mortal decay\
And moral obsolescence\
In through the out doors of brothels\
Where the boxer conducts his tyranny\
In pauses of saxophones\
Under the surveillance of light bulb drones\
In groans of mothers turning into fugitive whores\
And their muffled moans in bedrooms\
In half torn pages of bibles in a reverent home\
In patient onslaught of self slaughter\
In blanket tears between eulogy choirs\
In hospices where limbo hangs by the spring rain\
In breakthroughs by the tram sheds\
In blurred photographs of years gone by\
In outstretched guilt that envelopes enslaved love\
In between painting horses for a living\
In bravery of writing this poem\
I recognize myself\
I live
