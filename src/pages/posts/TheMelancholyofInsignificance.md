I dreamt of a man once,deep into the desert\
Trying to put together his broken heart\
By papering over the cracks with his broken fingernails\
And building his rib cage,like a barbed wire fence\
With words,stolen from the lips of ordinary men\
Like one more thin gypsy thief\
Sorrow bloomed in his eyes\
Like a cherry parfait\
And he carried the same mark\
Of all beings loved too little,too late\
He spoke the common tongue\
With clarity and conviction\
He had the common touch\
One that has stood it's trial\
In the festival of insignificance\
For tens of thousands of years\
He has roamed from road to road\
From home to home\
He has been a prisoner of distance\
Like an ill-fated shipwreck,in the middle of pacific\
He sung songs,one after another\
As words grew bitter by the hour\
Till there were no more surviors\
And his voice eaten,with desire\
Crashed on his ruby lips\
Like a runaway train,with no one in\
Of mandatory insignificance\
That he has endured,as one endures\
When one walks one step too far
