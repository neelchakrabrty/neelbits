I swallow the world in, as I stand on the precipice of nostalgia \
I wear my skin, like the pacific \
I wear it, with no memory \
I pace around my room, like a newborn\
Waiting for your arrival\
I forget, the ease with which I forget\
Suffering, my own \
And borrowed \
I remember, things I ought to forget \
Unlike water, I have memory \
I canâ€™t become water,\
My salvation lies in the fact that I cannot\
Will not\
Forget \
You
