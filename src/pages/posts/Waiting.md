On most days,I want to sing\
I don't really know how to sing\
I start with a slow,almost electronic hum to one of John's songs\
And then that hum disappears into silence 

On most days,I want to paint\
I don't really know how to paint\
I start with scribbling dots and lines\
Sometimes, I draw words\
A big N there, or a big E\
And then, from one letter to the next, my ink runs out\
And eventually, I stop

On most days,I want to dance \
I don't really know how to dance\
I don't know, for instance \
The difference between jumping around gracefully \
While unspooling the joy from the present tense \
And dancing. \
I hop around,jump around, \
And hope to feel a little bit better, \
By the end of it

On most days,I want to love\
I want to love,beyond alphabets\
And beyond language\
I want to get rid of the necessity of form\
And of object\
I want to love beyond nostalgia,\
I want to love further than sehnsucht\
I want to love, like it's some familiar\
Expression, or even a formal one
