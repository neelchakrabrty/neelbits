I want to go to you\
I don't care if it is decadent\
I will morph into night air\
And you'll breathe it in,knowing it's malignant\
But that's alright,tonight we die together\
Hand in unlovable hand

I want to visit the crevices of your self\
Buried in deep\
Mortal stagnation visits me in my sleep\
There is nowhere else I want to be\
And nobody else I want to see\
But that's alright,tonight we die together\
Married in misery

Pieces of a broken man\
Floats by your eyes in vain\
Particles of torment\
Make their way into your brain\
I hear murmurs of sorrow seeking tenant in your self\
And you can't hide\
Or even walk away\
But that's alright,tonight we die together\
Buried in a graveyard, where beliefs decay

You can convince the world\
That you're some kind of poet\
When an elaborate act of charade is what you are\
But that's alright\
But that's alright,tonight we die together
