To those of us,

Who debate the intricacies of incessant longing \
Longing that walks hand in hand with our solitary spirit \
Spirit that is chained into the fossils of our identity \
Identity, that we teeth into\
Like a bird stealing bread, to ensure their survival \
To ensure our death\
To those of us, \
Who cannot indulge, in the present out of fear of the future \
Who cannot see beyond the past that is magnified \
Who are reticent in decay, reticent beyond reason \
Believe, \
Believe as you did in your motherâ€™s arms when you were young\
To those of us, \
Who were sold safety in death\
Who were apprehensive of sunsets\
Who fished for their dreams in sewers of acceptability \
Who drew cautious borders around themselves \
Who grew old in a room, all alone\
Who will get buried in empty coffins \
And be reminisced in textless tombstones \
This poem is for you\
I love you
