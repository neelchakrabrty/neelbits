I broke free on a Sunday morning\
I put my flailing hands on the floor\
Was in-between my steps out the exit door\
And listened to my thawed heart let out a roar

As I stood on the roof, my eyes wide shut, as the morning poured\
I heard the expired screams for help, etch a catalogue of scars\
I heard monologues of self-declared love, for me and for you\
I could feel death inside me hum the funeral choir

And then in a cavalcade of anger and fear\
I traded swigs from a bottle of gin, distilled for unannounced departures,all bitter and clean\
In a drunken haze, I declared momentary love for the living\
I was sixteen years young, hurt my knuckles cleaning out my grieving catacomb\
The taste of betrayal, rich on my tongue

I ducked behind the shadows of my self, when I saw flickers of the moon\
Stitched myself to the leftover bleeding light, and stared at the pool\
And down at the pool, I learnt a thing or two about my happenstance coup on my own self\
In a moment of confused guilt, I tried to pray\
That I will mend my ways\
And walk the straight path to the end of my days
