# 1
I’ve woken up to bad days\
I’ve quenched my thirst for life \
With inadequate sorrow\
I’ve watched sunsets \
I’ve watched the birds come home\
I believe in coming home\
I believe that life could be a lot worse\
I have to consume life\
In bad times,with faith\
I have to live, \
I have to believe in hope\
Call it dangerous \
But I have to, \
Linger on, like a pale dot\
In a manuscript \
Washed away by\
Monsoon 
# 2
As I blink at life \
Through the lens \
of my tear stained eyes \
To negotiate\
The terms of my sorrow \
No matter, how elaborate \
My charade \
I won’t return home \
To a woman\
Making soup, or just \
Just, boiling some bones 
# 3
Hope is a slaughterhouse \
Belief is a graveyard \
Sorrow is a lonely house\
And loneliness is a prison\
I carry them all, \
In the fingertips of what remains\
Of me
# 4
I walk around\
Beheaded \
Beastly in form and shape \
I’m human\
I’m in despair \
And I have not, a song to sing \
I’m in need of saving, \
But it’s been sometime now, and I think \
I’ll be all better tomorrow \
I have to bite into the grandeur of hopeful tomorrows \
That’s all I can do, to live\
As I stare into the \
Whirlpool on my ceiling \
Every night\
I think of drowning \
But no one’s coming with me 
# 5
And I believe, \
In the spectrum of life\
In the tired and weary, homesick memories \
In love, that’s stranded in the desert between us \
In wrecked houses with aching windows\
In an identity of waiting \
In lullabies sung by the dying \
For the living\
In canyons that run through broken femurs \
And in silhouettes of worn out smiles\
I believe,\
I exist, I exist \
I find myself, over and over \
Again and again\
In this strange life
